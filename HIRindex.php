	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	
	<p>
		Human Interface Resources is a company dedicated to designing professional applications for the 21st century business environment.  The primary objective for a web designer should always be to create a functional application in accordance with the wishes of the client.  Human Interface Resources is committed to this concept, but also to the idea that creativity must also play an important role.  Web pages are no longer a place for bare bones form and function, the tools and knowledge exist today for creativity to become an integral part of the web design process.  A web application should be as pleasing to the eye as it is to the mind.  A well designed web site should be able to draw in its users with flash and keep them there with substance.  HIR is dedicated to this ideal; we will design an application to specifications, but with an added ingenuity that will create the best possible web experience.
