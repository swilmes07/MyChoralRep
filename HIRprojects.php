	<h1>Current Project</h1>

	<h2>MyChoralRep</h2>
		<div class='adjustLeft'>
			<p>
				This project was inspired by Dr. Roger Hale. He is the Assistant Professor of Choral Music Education and Voice at Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri. He wanted to create a web application that choral directors from around the country can view what other choral directors are performing for their concerts. Before MyChoralRep, nothing like it existed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				With MyChoralRep, choral directors can enter their performance information about their programs into their created profile. Along with entering their program information, they can also search and view other choral director's profiles and see what they are performing for their concerts. They can also view trends of which music pieces are being performed the most.
